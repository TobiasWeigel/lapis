Welcome to the Digital Object Infrastructure documentation!
===========================================================

The Digital Object Infrastructure python package can be used by domain-specific services to create and manage
Digital Objects (Kahn & Wilensky 2006). On the user's side, high-level APIs provide simplified interaction with 
the backend Digital Object / Persistent Identifier infrastructure. The basic idea is that users do not have to know
about Digital Objects and their storage methods at all, and just get a plain view of events and (perhaps) PIDs.
